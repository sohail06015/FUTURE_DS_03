# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard Using Power BI

An interactive dashboard designed to analyze road accident data across the UK, highlighting accident hotspots, severity trends, and vehicle-wise patterns for enhanced road safety insights.

---

## Project Overview

This project presents a dynamic **Power BI dashboard** analyzing road accidents, casualties, and patterns across various dimensions.  
The goal is to identify **high-risk locations**, **accident causes**, and **trends** to support policy planning and public safety improvements.

---

## Dataset Used

The dataset used includes real-world accident records with attributes such as:

- Casualty type & severity (fatal, serious, slight)
- Vehicle types involved
- Road surface & light conditions
- Urban vs rural settings
- Time-wise (monthly) distribution
- Geographic coordinates
